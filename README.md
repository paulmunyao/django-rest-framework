# django-rest-framework
A project that I had set to learn how to use circleci(CircleCI is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform that can be used to implement DevOps practices)

# Sources
Source https://circleci.com/  and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CircleCI

# How I wrote my workflow
I had written my flow of work in the yaml file such that it can run outomated test for my project and also my workflow had test to add installed dependancies inside the requiremets.txt file and afterwards to check if I can merge a branch to the master.

# More information
I had written my workflow on the master branch such that when I merge the branch to master it runs the necessary tests and notifies me where the necessary errors are in the project
for my branch I had named it circleci-project-setup
