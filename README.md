# django-rest-framework
A project that I had set to learn how to use circleci(CircleCI is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform that can be used to implement DevOps practices)
Source https://circleci.com/  and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CircleCI
I had written my flow of work in the yaml file such that it can run outomated test for my project and also my workflow had test to add installed dependancies inside the requiremets.txt file and afterwards to check if I can merge a branch to the master.
